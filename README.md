Here is a stat bot for the RCS discord that i wrote, hooking the steam API to get a players rust stats.

I'm releasing this after I got banned for an image they made showing me 'scripting' which is not true and a lie, this has also happened to various other people. The admins here are corrupt banning people for combat logs showing different IDs getting headshots and calling people scripters.

Apart from that the server lags to shit and you'll get fly hacked for standing on rocks, the admins are braindead and don't know how to whitelist and respond to tickets. All in all this community is a shambles.
